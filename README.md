# COVID-19-Responses

## Data
`Data` foler contains all the raw data, including `coronanet-release.csv`, `owid-covid-data.csv`, and `worldometer_scraper` (a web scraper intended to get COVID19 data but finally chose not use the data that it scrapes). It does not contain the WDI data due to the size limitation. 

## Presentation 
`Presentation` foler contains the rmd file that creates the presentation, pdf file, and `covid.csv`, which are the merged dataframes of COVID-19 data and World Development Indicator.
